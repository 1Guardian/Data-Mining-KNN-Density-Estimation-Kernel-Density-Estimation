# Data-Mining-KNN-Density-Estimation-Kernel-Density-Estimation

This project shows how to use kernel density estimation and k-nn density estimation to estimate the curve of a given distribution through the density. It also shows how over fitting and underfitting affect the plot. 

The end of the project also showcases histograms, but this work is not my own and is my lab partner's work, who is credited in the header of the pdf.

The project is in a pdf version of the ipynb for easier viewing by anyone
